What is angular?
    -Angular is a frontend framework for building client
    side applications. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and
    javascript/typescript. We commonly see Angular
    written in typescript.
    -Angular is component based and uses modules; each
    component represents a building block for the
    view (think MVC).

Angular JS vs Angular?
    Angular JS is Angular's version 1.
    BUT....in Angular 2+ there have been SO many changes
    implemented that it feels like an entirely different
    language.
    We will be using Angular 7. SO....if your google
    search returns search results for "Angular JS" then
    you had better be more specific.

To create a new angular project
   "ng new yourProjectName"
